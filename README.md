![alttext](assets/app-screenshot.png "HTML Screenshot")

This application uses [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) to test class syntax/constructor functions and [Inquirer.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) to prompt the user with questions that assist in building a team.html webpage featuring each member's information. 

After the prompts are answered by the user, the application automatically generates an HTML page displaying the manager's team.
